description: The JOYCO Registry is a public knowledge hub the team uses to share knowledge and resources. It contains a collection of components, tools and resources that are used internally.

import { ArrowRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'
import { CardLinkGrid, CardLink } from '@/components/card-link'

## Quick Links
You can find two main categories of content in the registry:

<CardLinkGrid>
  <CardLink href="/components" title="Components" description="Shadcn UI components and hooks." />
  <CardLink href="/toolbox" title="Toolbox" description="Scripts, tools and resources." />
</CardLinkGrid>

## Add this registry to your project
Paste this into your `components.json` file to pull components like `@joyco/{component}.json`.
```json title="components.json"
"registries": {
  "@joyco": "https://registry.joyco.studio/r/{name}.json"
}
```
